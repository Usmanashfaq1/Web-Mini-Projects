# Web Mini Projects

## About Me

Hi! I'm a recent software engineering graduate from FAST-CFD-PAKISTAN, I am an aspiring web developer on a journey to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and web dev best practices. Iâ€™m passionate about learning by doing, and I created this repository to track my growth and projects as I progress in the world of web development.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a personal journal and project space where I:

- Build mini web development projects
- Experiment with frontend and backend technologies
- Document what I learn day by day

Itâ€™s not just a collection of code â€” itâ€™s a reflection of my learning process.

## What I Am Learning

Iâ€™m currently focused on the following technologies and concepts:

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** â€“ Core web technologies
- **Responsive Design** â€“ Making websites look great on all devices
- **React** â€“ Component-based frontend development
- **Node.js & Express** â€“ Backend development and REST APIs
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for full-stack applications
- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)** â€“ Managing code changes and collaboration
- **Best Practices** â€“ Clean code, file structure, and reusable components

## How I am learning (Sources)

- **Using ChatGPT, GROK AI by following ROADMAP.SH (A site which have dedicated roadmap to learn somethingðŸ˜Š).
- **Youtube, Stackover flow, Offical documentation.



## How to Use This Repository

To keep my learning organized, Iâ€™m using a branch-based structure:

- `html-css-js` â€“ For learning and practicing the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `react` â€“ For exploring and understanding React concepts and building React components
- `main` â€“ This is the production branch where Iâ€™ll upload full working real-life projects that combine everything Iâ€™ve learned

To explore a specific topic, switch to the appropriate branch. (I have created seprate branches for react, html-css-js etc...)
